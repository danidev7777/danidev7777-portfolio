    body: "React Hooks are a feature introduced in React (version 16.8) that allow you to use state and other React features outside of class components. They let you reuse logic between functions without creating a new component or a higher-order component. Here are some popular React hooks: 1. useState: This hook allows functional components to have state. It accepts an initial value and returns a state variable and a function to update it. Example: ```javascript import { useState } from 'react'; function Example() { const [count, setCount] = useState(0); return ( <div> Count - {count} <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}> Increment </button> </div> ); } ``` 2. useEffect: This hook lets you perform side effects in function components, such as fetching data, subscribing to events, and more. It accepts a callback function and an array of dependencies. The function is called after the render, and if the dependencies change, it will be called again. Example: ```javascript import { useEffect } from 'react'; function Example() { useEffect(() => { document.title = Page title; }, []); // Empty array means it only runs once on mount and unmount } ",
